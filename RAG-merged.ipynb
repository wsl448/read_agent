    "However, their inference requires a significant amount of computations, memory, and energy.\n",
    "LLM inference has two main phases: during the prefill phase, the prompt is processed and cached in\n",
    "each layer, and then in the decoding phase the output tokens are generated one-by-one. The prefill\n",
    "phase is usually compute-bound while the decoding phase is known to be memory-bound.\n",
    "Quantization is among the most important techniques to solve both memory and compute issues\n",
    "during LLM inference. Joint quantization aims to reduce the precision of parameters and KV cache\n",
    "(which results in lower memory usage) as well as inputs (known as activations) and compute the\n",
    "forward pass in low precision. However, quantizing the activations is hard as they have large outlier\n",

    "relies on characterizing outlier features using a calibration set and keeping them in higher precision\n",

    "In this work, we address the issue of outlier features by rotating the inputs of the model using randomized\n",
    "Hadamard transformations. We do this using the computational invariance idea [Ashkboos et al.,\n",
    "2024] and fuse Hadamard transformations into the weight matrices, resulting in an equivalent network\n",

    "**Methodology:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors propose a novel quantization method called Quamba, which is specifically designed for SSMs. Quamba uses a combination of techniques, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Percentile-based quantization for the input activation tensor (𝑥) to reduce the impact of outliers.\n",
    "2. Hadamard transform to remove outliers from the output activation tensor (𝑦).\n",
    "3. Symmetric uniform quantization for weights and activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors also re-implement QuaRot, a state-of-the-art low-bitwidth quantization method for Transformers, for the Mamba structure, and compare its performance with Quamba.\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The authors conduct extensive experiments on the Mamba family of SSMs and a hybrid architecture composed of self-attention, SSMs, and Mixture of Experts (MoE). The results show that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Quamba achieves similar perplexity to the re-implemented QuaRot-SSM but delivers a better speedup on both A5000 and Nano.\n",
    "2. Quamba reduces the size of the 2.8B model nearly by half (5.29 GB vs. 2.76 GB) by quantizing weights as 8-bit integers.\n",
    "3. Quamba improves the latency by 1.27× with a 512 input context (i.e., time-to-first-token, TTFT) on the A5000 GPU and 1.21× in the generation stage (i.e., L=1, time-per-output-token, TPOT).\n",
    "4. Quamba achieves a 0.9% accuracy drop compared to floating-point Mamba 2.8B and outperforms Mamba-PTQ and SmQ-SSM in accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "1. The accuracy degradation is not negligible in both accuracy and perplexity.\n",
    "2. The performance trade-off is acceptable given the significant improvements in latency and resource efficiency.\n",
    "3. The method may push the development of privacy-centric on-device applications, but it may also present challenges such as increased device resource consumption and potential security vulnerabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The authors propose a method called QuaRot, which uses Hadamard matrices to eliminate outliers in the activations and KV cache of pre-trained LLMs.\n",

    "3. The authors use a combination of online Hadamard operations and weight modifications to achieve this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",

    "1. QuaRot achieves up to 2.16x speedup on RTX 3090 GPUs during the prefill stage and up to 3.39x memory saving during the decoding stage.\n",
    "2. QuaRot maintains 99% of the downstream task performance of the FP16 baseline when quantizing LLAMA 2-70B to 4 bits.\n",
